How do I approach designing software?

New design skills:
Through this project, I enhanced my abilities in planning and applying texture mapping, as well as managing scenes within a 3D rendering environment. I also developed a stronger understanding of handling transformations and organizing object hierarchies, which has been a significant addition to my skillset.

Design process:
My design method involved an iterative approach. I began by outlining the key components of the 3D scene, constructed the basic geometric forms, and then gradually introduced textures and lighting elements to enhance realism.

Future applications:
This design strategy will be useful in future projects involving complex environments. By breaking the work into smaller, manageable sections, I can maintain better control and focus, making large-scale projects more approachable and organized.

How do I approach developing programs?

New development strategies:
Throughout the development of the 3D scene, I emphasized modular programming, ensuring that individual features such as shape construction, lighting, and texture application were separated into distinct modules. This made debugging and future maintenance much simpler.

Iteration:
Frequent iteration was critical to my development process. I continually adjusted transformations and lighting settings to refine the sceneâ€™s realism, steadily improving the overall visual quality with each pass.

Evolution of development approach:
As the project progressed through its milestones, my programming practices evolved to become more efficient and methodical. By the final stages, I had adopted a habit of thoroughly testing individual components before integrating them into the larger system.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Educational pathway:
Working with computational graphics and visualizations has broadened my understanding of 3D environments, an important foundation for fields like game development and simulation design. As I continue my education, these skills will be crucial for advancing into more complex graphics programming.

Professional pathway:
Being able to create and manipulate visual representations through computational graphics is a highly valuable skill for a future career as a software engineer. These abilities will open doors in industries requiring immersive technologies like VR, AR, simulation modeling, and even architectural visualization.
